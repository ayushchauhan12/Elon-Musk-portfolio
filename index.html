  <div class="container3">Musk made his first $165 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002. He was first listed on the
     Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.
    At the start of 2020, Musk was the 35th richest person in the world, with a net worth of $27 billion
    Around three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla. Musk does not receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed in 2018
     to a compensation plan with the board that ties his personal earnings
     to Tesla's valuation and revenue. The deal stipulated that Musk only receive the compensation if Tesla reached certain
      market values. It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and board, and has been described in one lawsuit 
      as "excessive".In the first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares (about 1% of 
      the company) at below-market prices, which was worth about $800 million
